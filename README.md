# I-JEPA: Self-Supervised Learning for Animal Classification

## Overview

This repository implements the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) for self-supervised learning on an animal image dataset. I-JEPA is a state-of-the-art approach that learns meaningful image representations by predicting representations of target image regions from context regions without relying on hand-crafted data augmentations.

The project also includes a comparative evaluation with SimCLR (Simple Contrastive Learning of Representations), providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different self-supervised learning approaches.
